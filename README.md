## This repository has moved and is now called [Vuekyne](https://github.com/xdarkyne/vuekyne). 
Vuekyne is a rework of darkyne.com (PHPkyne) using Vue3, typescript, express and scss. This project was created to learn webdevelopment since I don't need authentication on my portfolio and I wanted to learn Vue I decided to rewrite the portfolio using a different tech stack. Vuekyne is now cleaner, faster, prettier, better. 

## Description
This was my first attempt at Web-Development using PHP (Laravel to be exact), html, scss and TypeScript. I created this as my personal portfolio learning the use of databases, authentication, typescript, apis and more along the way.
